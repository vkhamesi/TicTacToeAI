# TicTacToeAI
Object oriented programming in Python of the TicTacToe game and development of an artificial neural network (Q-learning) that learns to play on a game history.

This personal project consisted in creating a game of TicTacToe from scratch in Python, in object-oriented programming. The final application allows to play 1 vs 1, but also to train an artificial neural network via TensorFlow to play against an AI.

# TicTacToeAI
Object oriented programming in Python of the TicTacToe game and development of an artificial neural network (Q-learning) that learns to play on a game history.

This personal project consisted in creating a game of TicTacToe from scratch in Python, in object-oriented programming. The final application allows to play 1 vs 1, but also to train an artificial neural network via TensorFlow to play against an AI.

Actually, the player vs AI game mode has not been implemented as this project was not made for distribution but educational purpose. The AI only advises the player which move is the best according to the training games.
